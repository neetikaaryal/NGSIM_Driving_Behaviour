Traffic Dynamics and Behavior Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vehicle trajectory data to improve traffic efficiency and safety. By examining real-world and simulated traffic data, we aim to provide actionable insights for traffic management and policy recommendations. Our investigation covers traffic pattern analysis, driving behavior analysis, and application-driven proposals for enhancing traffic systems.
